# Note Types

I've made some major changes to the available note types in this deck. (I removed most of the old ones, since I found I never actually used them)

* pretttyBasic - A pretty basic card with front and back
* prettyCloze - Pretty cloze card, also has a title and an extra field
* prettyPoem - A card for memorizing poems or quotes
* prettyWord - A card for memorizing vocabulary
